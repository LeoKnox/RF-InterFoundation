# RF-InterFoundation
Recursive Fill and Intermediate Foundation algorithms

indexorig.html - contains orignal recursive fill assignment code
index.html - my code with recursive fill completed
fill.js - my original test code using 0's and 1's
intermediateFoundation.js - Algorithm solutions

The original solution code for recursive fill wasn't very useful as I used different variables and fucntion names making it dificult to debug and required a lot of rewriting. DON'T DO THIS AGAIN. Even in testing names can be important.
